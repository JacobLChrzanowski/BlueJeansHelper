# BlueJeansHelper

BlueJeans has a bug that sometime the Quit option in the context menu is greyed out and you have to go into the Task Manager to close it.
This small script launches a taskbar icon that lets you quickly and easily close or reopen BlueJeans.

Credit where credit is due, 99% of the tray icon code was from https://stackoverflow.com/a/48775936 which itself was ripped off from "Mark Hammond's win32gui_taskbar.py and win32gui_menu.py demos from PyWin32"
